## About
During my freshman and sophomore years in undergrad, I wanted to get a PhD in mathematics. Although I didnâ€™t have time for all the formal math classes, I decided to self-study topics that interested me. Over time, I collected various books and papers, and this repository is the result of that journey.

If you share an unexplainable (and unmarketable) interest in mathematics and simply want to spend time learning about it, this repository is for you!
